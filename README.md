(Note: This entire chrome extension, and the README, was generated with ChatGPT - with some light editing. I'll let the robot take it from here...)


The Dominion Game Counter is a simple Chrome extension that helps prevent you from playing too many games of Dominion Online in a single session. The extension will block you from starting a new game once you've reached your game limit, reminding you to take a break.

## Installation

Since the Dominion Game Counter is not currently available on the Chrome Web Store, you will need to install it manually. Here are the steps:

1. Download the latest version of the extension by clicking on the "Code" button above and selecting "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip the downloaded file to a location of your choice.
3. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to "chrome://extensions" in the address bar.
4. Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner of the page.
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page and select the unzipped extension folder.
6. The Dominion Game Counter should now be installed and ready to use.

## Usage

1. Navigate to Dominion Online and start a game as usual.
2. Once the game starts, the Dominion Game Counter will keep track of how many games you've played.
3. Once you've reached the limit you set (default is 2), the "Start Search" button will be disabled.

## About the Author

The Dominion Game Counter extension was written by ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. As an AI language model, ChatGPT has a deep understanding of natural language and can generate human-like responses to a wide range of prompts. The Dominion Game Counter is just one example of the many useful tools and applications that can be created with the power of AI.
